# Trello-Clone
 
Check out the live [app](https://trello2.herokuapp.com/).

Trello-Clone is a single-page full-stack web application modeled after Trello. Trello-Clone is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Socket.io on the back-end, and Vue.js and Vuex on the front-end.  For image hosting, it utilizes Amazon Web Services. For instant data transfer, it uses socket.io to integrate Vue.js frontend with the rest of the node.js & express.js application.

## Why trello clone?
Our dev team was inspired by beautiful and seamless frontend Trello's UIs. It is one of the most popular web-based Kanban-style list-making applications. Trelloâ€™s boards, lists, and cards enable users to organize and prioritize their projects and daily tasks in a fun, interactive, and rewarding way.

Trello has numerous technical details over the entire applications. One good example is the communications between frontend and backend, such as using socket.io and HTTP request calls selectively. Our team of four tried to implement this well polished application in two months time periods, and now release the beta version of the application.
